                    <p class="week-para">
                        This week, we delved into the realm of game development using Node.js, 
                        crafting our very own creation. The initial step involved meticulously 
                        planning out the game's flow by sketching a comprehensive flowchart. 
                        This blueprint ensured that our development process remained aligned with 
                        our envisioned design. To implement the escape room game, we relied on a 
                        trio of essential modules: inquirer, chalk, and emoji. Leveraging the 
                        inquirer module facilitated seamless interaction with users through prompts,
                         enabling them to navigate options such as selecting the difficulty level. 
                         The game offered three difficulty settings: easy, medium, and hard, each 
                         presenting its unique challenges. In the easy mode, players faced a choice 
                         between three doors, one of which concealed a prize while the others harbored
                          ghosts. Selecting the incorrect door resulted in the loss of one of three lives,
                           a cycle repeated over five rounds. The medium and hard modes ramped up the 
                           challenge with five and seven doors, respectively. Losing all three lives 
                           spelled defeat for the player. To visually enhance the experience, we 
                           incorporated emojis, including hearts to represent lives, door icons, and 
                           ghost figures. The chalk module was instrumental in adding vibrant colors 
                           to the text, enriching the game's visual appeal. Furthermore, we structured a 
                           character class endowed with properties such as name, life, wrong, and round, 
                           complemented by functions like rightGuess, wrongGuess, wonGame, and lostGame. 
                           These elements dynamically responded to the game's progress, 
                        ensuring an immersive and engaging experience for players.

                        Project management software is designed to help businesses and 
                        individuals track projects, tasks and schedules. 
                        The core value of this kind of software is its ability to bring 
                        structure to complexity. It's a great tool for staying organized 
                        and ensuring your team remains on task and aligned with project 
                        objectives. While each development company may use a slightly different software 
                        process, each have at least 6 stages in common: 
                        planning, designing, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
