                        For our first group project our mentor provided us with a codebase 
                        containing deliberate errors and empty sections to complete. 
                        This exercise was designed to challenge us to apply the concepts 
                        we had learned and collaborate effectively as a team to troubleshoot issues 
                        and implement solutions. Working together, we analyzed the existing code to 
                        identify and rectify errors, ensuring that the application would function correctly. 
                        Additionally, we utilized our knowledge and skills to fill in the empty sections, 
                        implementing the necessary logic and functionality to achieve the desired outcomes. 
                        Throughout the process, we engaged in active communication, sharing ideas, discussing 
                        potential solutions, and collaborating to overcome obstacles. This hands-on experience
                         not only deepened our understanding of the programming concepts but also fostered teamwork 
                         and problem-solving skills essential for success in software development projects.

                        After presenting power poinps that we made week before we received valuable feedback from our mentor regarding our project. 
                        The feedback covered various aspects such as the clarity of our concept, 
                        the completeness of our requirements, the coherence of our data schema, and the feasibility of our functionality and interface designs. Our mentor provided constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement, 
                        highlighting both the strengths of our project and areas where we could enhance it further. 
                        In our group, consisting of three members, we had to decide on a project to work on together.
                         The options we considered were my proposal for an E-commerce app, a movie review app, and an
                          expense and income management app. Each project idea had its own merits and potential 
                          for development. To make an informed decision, we discussed the feasibility, 
                          complexity, and potential impact of each project. After thorough deliberation and 
                          considering factors such as our interests, skills, and available resources, we collectively 
                          decided to pursue the development of a movie review app. Once we made the decision, 
                          we immediately began conducting research to gather information about existing movie review 
                          websites and available APIs that could provide us with relevant data. This initial phase of
                           research allowed us to gain insights into the features and functionalities commonly found 
                           in movie review platforms and helped us define the scope of our project more clearly. 
                           Overall, our collaborative decision-making process enabled us to choose a project that
                            we were all excited about and confident in our ability to execute effectively.
