                    <p class="week-para">
                        A full-stack application represents a comprehensive software solution
                        that seamlessly integrates both the frontend and backend components
                        within a single code base. This enables the application
                        to deliver end-to-end functionality, from user interface interactions to
                        server-side data processing and storage. This week task was to closely follow the mentor's
                        guidance and
                        replicate their code implementations while actively engaging in the
                        learning process. We had the opportunity to observe firsthand how
                        various frontend and backend technologies interacted to create a
                        cohesive application architecture. Additionally, we were encouraged
                        to ask questions and seek clarification whenever necessary.
                        Through this hands-on experience, we developed a deeper
                        understanding of the complexities involved in building and maintaining
                        modern software systems, equipping us with the skills and knowledge to
                        tackle future projects with confidence.

                    <p class="week-para">
                        This week task was to make a power points presentation on final project to be presented next
                        week (Dragon Den style).
                        The project I've selected to pursue is an E-commerce application. In my presentation, I will
                        cover various aspects including the concept, requirements, data schema, functionality, and
                        interface designs.
                        The concept of the E-commerce app revolves around creating a platform where users can browse,
                        search, and purchase products online. It aims to provide a seamless and convenient shopping
                        experience to customers while also offering sellers a platform to showcase and sell their
                        products.
                        In terms of requirements, the application will need to support user authentication, product
                        listings with detailed descriptions and images, shopping cart functionality,and user reviews. 
                        Additionally, it should be responsive and
                        accessible across different devices and screen sizes.
                        The data schema will include tables for users, products, orders, payments, and reviews. Each
                        table will have appropriate fields to store relevant information, and relationships between
                        tables will be established to ensure data integrity and consistency.
                        Functionality-wise, users will be able to register and login, browse products by category or
                        search for specific items, add products to their cart.
                        For the interface designs, I will use flowcharts or pseudocode to illustrate the navigation flow
                        and interactions within the application. This will include diagrams showing the different
                        screens and user actions, as well as how they are connected and function together to achieve the
                        desired user experience.
